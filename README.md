# My Portfolio

## Description

This site was developed to serve as my presence on the web, particularly for prospective employers.  It contains an introductory "About Me" page, a portfolio page containing links to projects I've worked on, and a contact page.

This project was built with HTML and CSS written from scratch.

## Opportunities For Further Development

All of the projects/links on the Portfolio page are placeholders for now. As I complete other projects, I can create additional pages for those projects and link them here.

The form on the Contact page does not currently capture and do anything with the input.

The About Me page could use a better headshot.

## Credits

All images and referenced products on the Portfolio page are intended as placeholders only.  I've chosen them either because I have some work experience related to them (Rock Band Network and Rockstar Rising), or simply because I am a fan of them (Mass Effect, Inside, Magic: The Gathering).

Rock Band Network is a content creation and distribution system designed by [Harmonix](https://www.harmonixmusic.com/) with help from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us).

Rockstar Rising is a game created by [Offbeat Entertainment](https://www.offbeatent.com/) for [Whotune](https://www.facebook.com/Whotune/).

Mass Effect is a video game series developed by [BioWare](http://www.bioware.com/) and published by [Microsoft Game Studios](https://www.microsoftstudios.com/) and [Electronic Arts](https://www.ea.com/).

Inside is a video game developed and published by [Playdead](https://playdead.com/).

Magic: The Gathering is a collectible and digital card game created by [Richard Garfield](https://www.facebook.com/Richard-Garfield-147420095374222/) and published by [Wizards of the Coast](https://company.wizards.com/).  The art pictured is by [Seb McKinnon](http://www.sebmckinnon.com/) and is featured on the card "Stream of Thought".
