        <p class="main-content">I am an aspiring web developer sharpening my skills at the University of Richmond Coding Boot Camp.  I am building on the knowledge I gained earning my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Denver (class of 2004).</p>
        <p class="main-content">I began my career in the financial services industry, working at Charles Schwab & Co. from 2004 to 2010.  As a licensed broker, I worked extensively with financial management and trading web sites and desktop applications.  From 2010 to 2013, I contributed in many roles at Offbeat Entertainment - a startup music-focused video game development studio.  I led the team that developed content for the Rock Band Network and was the primary content designer for the Facebook game Rockstar Rising.</p>
        <p class="main-content">After spending the past few years at home with my young son, I am excited to be updating my coding skills!  In my free time, I enjoy video games, board games, Magic: The Gathering, and outdoor activities.</p>
